## How responses land here

Each research issue (V-1…V-10) has **one assignee**. That person shares **their own
first-person experience** (not a survey of other people) by opening a **PR that adds their
own `### V-X` section below**. One section per issue → no merge conflicts. The maintainer
reviews each PR for privacy before merging.

## The story we're proving for the SDF

A funding/grant case for MicoPay on Stellar rests on a few claims. The research issues each
supply evidence for one of them:

| Claim                    | Backed by                                         | One-line thesis                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Demand exists**     | V-1 (cash-out), V-2 (cash-in), V-6 (remittances)  | A real, recurring pain converting digital ↔ cash           |
| **2. Supply exists**     | V-3 (liquidity providers)                         | Real people/businesses would provide cash for a commission |
| **3. It can win**        | V-7 (alternatives), V-8 (fair fee)                | Better than current options, at a fee users accept         |
| **4. Stellar is usable** | V-4 (non-custodial onboarding)                    | Mainstream users can handle a self-custodial wallet        |
| **5. Trust / PMF**       | V-5 (flow trust), V-9 (safety), V-10 (repeat use) | Users would adopt, feel safe, and come back                |

> Put together: **demand + supply + a winning, affordable, usable, trusted experience = a
> credible case that a Stellar P2P cash network serves the financially underserved.**

## Macro context (TAM — from public data, not from this survey)

The _size_ of the problem comes from public sources; cite them in the deck. The survey adds
_willingness and trust_, which public data can't give. Approximate figures to verify and cite:

- Remittances to Mexico: ~US$60B+/year (cite World Bank / Banxico, latest year).
- Share of population unbanked / underbanked in Mexico: majority (cite ENIF / World Bank Findex).
- (Add the equivalent figure for any other region respondents come from.)

> The survey's job is **not** to size the market — it's to show that, on top of a known huge
> market, real people are **willing** to use this specific Stellar-based solution.

## Methodology note (state this honestly in the deck)

- **First-person:** each entry is **one contributor's own experience**, not a survey of others.
- **Convenience sample**, self-selected via the Drips program — **directional/qualitative
  signal, not a representative study.** Report it as such; do not present as statistically rigorous.
- Anonymized and privacy-first: **no personal data and no money amounts collected.**
- Sample size is small; report `N` plainly and let the patterns speak.

## Aggregate findings (one `### V-X` section per contributor PR)

### V-1 · Cash-out context
**Contributor:** [@larryjay007](https://github.com/larryjay007) · **PR:** [#155](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/155) · **Region:** Nigeria (South West)

First-person response (privacy-safe):

- **Country / region:** Nigeria (South West)
- **Cash-out frequency:** Weekly
- **Current method:** Peer-to-peer exchange or bank transfer to a local bank account, followed by ATM withdrawal or cash-out through a POS agent.
- **Main friction:** High cumulative transaction fees, unreliable ATM availability, and daily withdrawal limits.
- **Personal experience:** I frequently receive digital funds and need physical cash for everyday expenses such as transportation and purchases at local markets. One recent experience was particularly frustrating — I spent more than an hour moving between three different bank locations because the first two had either empty ATMs or network issues. When I finally found a working ATM, the withdrawal limit was so low that I had to make multiple transactions, resulting in additional bank charges.

**SDF narrative:** Adds Nigeria (South West) to the cash-out demand signal for Claim 1. Weekly frequency + ATM reliability failures + daily withdrawal limits combine into a strong recurring pain that a local P2P agent network directly addresses.

### V-2 · Cash-in / deposit context
**Contributor:** [@Truphile](https://github.com/Truphile) · **PR:** [#159](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/159) · **Region:** Nigeria (West Africa)

First-person response (privacy-safe):

- **Why I'd use cash-in:** Getting paper money out of my hands and into my phone where it's actually useful. If I collect cash from a friend or an offline gig, I can't use that paper to pay for AWS bills, local utility tokens, or fund a fintech savings pocket. I need a quick way to drop the cash and see it hit my digital wallet instantly.
- **Current method:** I walk up to a nearby neighborhood PoS agent. I hand them the physical cash, give them my account details, and wait for them to do a transfer to my wallet on their terminal.
- **Frequency:** A few times a month — whenever paper cash piles up, I need to clear it out.
- **Trust barrier:** Network issues, hands down. The fear of handing over cold hard cash and then hearing the agent say "Network is bad, the money hasn't dropped yet." If the system crashes mid-operation, you're stuck arguing at a kiosk, waiting for a network reversal that could take 24–48 hours.
- **Local trusted providers:** Yes. There are established, branded kiosks and shops right on my street that have been there for years. Everyone in the area uses them, and because they are tied to a permanent physical location, they can't afford to ruin their reputation over a bad transaction.

**SDF narrative:** Confirms bidirectional demand (Claim 1) from West Africa — a user who actively needs to digitize physical cash and already trusts local PoS agents. The main risk to address is mid-operation network failure and confirmation latency.

### V-3 · Liquidity provider perspective

_(no responses yet)_

### V-4 · Non-custodial wallet onboarding
**Contributor:** [@Shadow-MMN](https://github.com/Shadow-MMN) · **PR:** [#157](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/157) · **Region:** —

- **Is it clear to YOU that you hold the key and must back it up?:** Not clear at all. There is no onboarding screen or maybe I am missing something but the keypair was generated (I found out by checking the brower's localStorage).
- **Your biggest doubt or fear about a non-custodial wallet:** Losing the key to a hacker since it is stored on my localStorage.
- **What would make YOU trust this onboarding:** I would not trust it in its current form because there is no onboarding at all. A dedicated screen at first launch explaining that a wallet was created and showing the public key, with a clear call to back up the secret key, would be the minimum.
- **Your preference: create a new wallet vs import an existing Stellar key (and why):** Import an existing wallet key. I already have a wallet with funds and do not want the hassle of moving money between wallets.
- **In your view, should backing up the key be mandatory at sign-up, or optional? (and why):** Optional, but the UI should make it trivially easy i.e a single tap to copy the key, accompanied by a visible note telling the user to save the copied text somewhere safe and never share it. Making it mandatory would frustrate users who just want to try the app, but the option should be prominent enough that nobody misses it.

### V-5 · Trust in the cash-in/cash-out flow
**Contributor:** [@Truphile](https://github.com/Truphile) · **PR:** [#158](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/158) · **Region:** Nigeria (West Africa)

First-person response (privacy-safe):

- **Most trusted provider type:** A well-established, branded neighborhood PoS agent with a permanent physical kiosk and a steady stream of daily customers. Seeing them use a dedicated, functional Android PoS terminal instantly builds confidence.
- **Least trusted:** A mobile, unbranded agent sitting casually on the street corner with just a phone, or an untrusted shop owner who claims "network is bad" before even attempting the transaction.
- **Minimum info before handing over cash:** The exact commission fee clearly stated upfront · the final locked-in value that will reflect in the wallet · a clear confirmation on the agent's screen showing the system is active and online.
- **Verification signals for providers:** The agent's location and banner name matching exactly what is displayed on the in-app map · a verified merchant status indicator showing a high completion rate or a "Trusted Agent" badge.
- **Support expectations mid-failure:** An immediate, automated SMS receipt or in-app "Pending / Money Received" status to prove the transaction is in flight · a clear WhatsApp support channel or toll-free line to resolve hanging transactions within minutes.
- **Top reason to abandon:** "Network Issues" and delay — if the agent says "network is fluctuating" or the app takes too long to generate the QR code/receipt. Any delay at point of payment triggers a fear of trapped funds.

**SDF narrative:** Directly maps the trust and abandonment signals for Claim 5 (Trust / PMF). The three-part "minimum info before handing over cash" is a concrete UX checklist — transparent fee, locked rate, online status — that the agent flow must display before cash changes hands.

### V-6 · Remittances cash-out context
**Contributor:** [@KaruG1999](https://github.com/KaruG1999) · **PR:** [#146](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/146) · **Region:** Argentina (LATAM)

First-person response (privacy-safe):

- Do I receive money from abroad? Yes — via stablecoins on Stellar/Soroban and P2P networks.
- How do I receive it today? Standard international banking wires trigger excessive regulatory friction, high inbound fees, and unfavorable official currency conversion rates. While crypto solves cross-border speed, cashing out stablecoins to local fiat still relies on P2P order books or physical OTC exchanges, with variable spread and counterparty risk.
- Would a nearby, same-day cash-out point help me? Yes. Eliminating the P2P counterparty matching phase and having an immediate, same-day physical cash-out point nearby would drastically reduce friction and eliminate exchange-rate slippage.

**SDF narrative:** Sharpest evidence for Claim 1 (demand exists) — a person who already uses Stellar for cross-border transfers and still lacks a trustworthy last-mile cash-out. MicoPay solves the final delivery step the network already carries.

### V-7 · Current alternatives & switching
**Contributor:** [@barnabasolutayo-lgtm](https://github.com/barnabasolutayo-lgtm) · **PR:** [#145](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/145) · **Regions:** Monterrey MX · Bogotá CO · Buenos Aires AR · Caracas VE

Multi-respondent batch (N=4, anonymized):

| Respondent | Current method | Main friction | Would switch for |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Monterrey, MX | OXXO + bank ATM | High convenience fees, queues, downtime | Lower fees, neighborhood exchange points |
| Bogotá, CO | Nequi / Daviplata + Efecty | App downtime, limits, high cash-out fees | 24/7 reliability, transparent fees, flexible limits |
| Buenos Aires, AR | Informal exchange houses + Binance P2P | Physical safety risks, P2P counterparty trust | Verified, trust-rated merchant network |
| Caracas, VE | Binance P2P + Pago Móvil + informal USD | Broker fees >5%, fiat/USD sourcing costs | Direct <2% connection to verified agents with escrow |

Switching dealbreakers across all four: upfront fees before handover · no immediate confirmation receipt · high platform fees · mandatory multi-day KYC · transaction failures.

**SDF narrative:** Validates Claim 3 (MicoPay can win) across four countries. Existing alternatives all fail on at least one of: fees, trust, or reliability — exactly what MicoPay addresses via Stellar escrow and reputation ratings.

### V-8 · Fair commission / fee tolerance
**Contributor:** [@rosemary21](https://github.com/rosemary21) · **PR:** [#148](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/148) · **Region:** Nigeria (Lagos area)

First-person response (privacy-safe):

- Fair fee range I would accept: 1–3% — enough to compensate the provider for time and liquidity risk, low enough that the service beats a traditional bank or agent.
- "Too expensive" threshold: >5%. Above that it feels exploitative and the traditional channel wins by default.
- What would justify stretching the ceiling: (1) not needing a bank account at all — that alone unlocks access; (2) same-day settlement; (3) verified provider + in-app dispute path.
- Would I pay a premium for a closer / faster provider? Yes. Proximity and speed justify a small premium over the base rate.

**SDF narrative:** Adds sub-Saharan Africa to the sample and contributes the clearest statement of the "no bank account needed" value proposition. The 1–5% fee band confirmed here matches signals from Venezuela and LATAM, establishing a cross-regional pricing anchor.

### V-9 · Safety meeting in person
**Contributor:** [@deep-bhikadiya](https://github.com/deep-bhikadiya) · **PR:** [#147](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/pull/147) · **Region:** India / South Asia

First-person response (privacy-safe):

- Comfort level meeting a stranger to exchange cash: Neutral — I would not say I am fully comfortable, but I could do it if the meeting place, timing, and person all felt trustworthy.
- Biggest safety fear: Being scammed or robbed. Secondary: fake cash, last-minute location change, being followed after leaving.
- What would make it feel safe: A busy public place during the day. Verified profiles, ratings, in-app chat, clear receipts, and a way to contact support would make the exchange feel more controlled.
- Preference — known shops vs individuals: I would prefer a known shop. It feels more accountable and easier to trace if something goes wrong. Meeting a random individual feels inherently more uncertain.

**SDF narrative:** Extends the geographic sample beyond LATAM into South Asia, confirming that safety concerns around in-person exchange are universal. The safety design requirements that emerge are directly actionable for the provider matching screen UX.

### V-10 · Product validation: repeat use & provider discovery

> Note: submitted in the earlier multi-respondent format (kept as-is). Newer entries are first-person.

Small anonymized sample (N=4; self + 3 peers, convenience sample across Mexico and other Latin American regions):

- Respondent A — Mexico City, Mexico
  - How they would expect to find a nearby provider: a map or list sorted by distance and availability, with search by area.
  - After a good first experience, would they use it again? Yes.
  - What would make them come back / not: transparent fees, reliable availability, and clear trust signals on the provider; they would hesitate if the process felt slow, unclear, or inconsistent.
  - What would make them recommend it: a fast, simple, trustworthy experience that saves time and reduces hassle compared with informal cash exchange.

- Respondent B — Guadalajara region, Mexico
  - How they would expect to find a nearby provider: a short list of nearby providers plus a referral from someone they trust.
  - After a good first experience, would they use it again? Yes.
  - What would make them come back / not: repeatability, predictable pricing, and visible proof that the provider is real and available; they would avoid it if there were hidden fees, weak verification, or poor support.
  - What would make them recommend it: the feeling that it is safer and more convenient than ad hoc arrangements.

- Respondent C — Bogotá area, Colombia
  - How they would expect to find a nearby provider: map + search first, with referrals as a secondary trust signal.
  - After a good first experience, would they use it again? Maybe.
  - What would make them come back / not: strong profile quality, easy repeat flow, and clear help if something goes wrong; they would be discouraged by uncertainty around provider quality or lack of support.
  - What would make them recommend it: if it felt dependable enough to share with friends and family.

- Respondent D — Lima area, Peru
  - How they would expect to find a nearby provider: search or a provider list with filters for distance, availability, and rating.
  - After a good first experience, would they use it again? Yes.
  - What would make them come back / not: a smooth repeat journey and good communication during the exchange; they would not return if the experience felt risky, confusing, or too manual.
  - What would make them recommend it: a clear, low-friction experience that felt easy to explain to someone else.

Aggregate signal:

- Discovery is likely to happen through a map/list and search, with referrals acting as a trust multiplier.
- Repeat use looks plausible if the first experience is fast, predictable, and visibly trustworthy.
- The main risk to repeat use is uncertainty around provider quality, availability, and support.
- Recommendation is strongest when the experience feels safe, simple, and easy to explain to a friend.

## How findings feed Wave 6 product work

- Cash-out vs cash-in vs remittance demand → which direction to prioritize first.
- Trust + safety signals a provider must show → P1-2 (map), P0-3 (real balance), receipts.
- Clarity of wallet backup → how mandatory to make it at sign-up (P0-5 / open question 3).
- Fair fee range → pricing/economics decisions.
- Discovery + minimum info before committing → Stage 2 UI work.
