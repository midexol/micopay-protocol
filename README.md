# 🍄 MicoPay Protocol

**The first API that gives AI agents access to physical cash in Mexico**

> Stellar Hacks: Agents — DoraHacks 2026

> 🌊 **We're in Drips Wave 6 — start here.** The focus is turning the retail mobile app (`micopay/frontend` + `micopay/backend`) from a single-device demo into a **real product**: one identity per device and a **real transaction between two phones**. **Contributors: read [`docs/AUDIT_APK_WAVE6.md`](./docs/AUDIT_APK_WAVE6.md)** — it's the Wave 6 source of truth (plan, issue queue, and acceptance criteria). Then jump to [Contributing](#contributing-drips-wave-6) · [`docs/`](./docs/)

> 🔐 **Real-World ZK on Stellar — live on testnet.** AI agents buy an **anonymous access credential** (x402) and spend it to consume resources like **Claude inference** — proving *"I have the right to consume this"* without revealing who they are or linking the spend to the purchase. Single-use, verified on-chain on Soroban. See [ZK-as-a-Service](#-zk-as-a-service--private-resource-access-for-ai-agents) below · [`docs/zk-agent-credentials/`](./docs/zk-agent-credentials/STATUS.md).

## What is MicoPay?

MicoPay is two things that work together:

**1. A mobile P2P app** — already live on Stellar testnet. Think Uber for crypto cashout: anyone with MXN cash (a neighbor, a street vendor, a tienda) can become a liquidity provider. Users with USDC get matched to the nearest available person and walk away with pesos in minutes. The app also includes UI screens for CETES bonds (Etherfuse), Blend DeFi, and bank on-ramp — mainnet-ready architecture, simulated on testnet. No bank account required.

**2. An x402 Protocol API** — built for this hackathon. Exposes the merchant network and HTLC engine to any AI agent via HTTP + micropayments. Claude, GPT, a Telegram bot, or a WhatsApp assistant can now do what MicoPay users do — in a single API call.

The connection: **the same Soroban HTLC contract** (`MicopayEscrow`, deployed) powers both the app and the agent API. We didn't build a demo — we opened up a real product to AI agents.

```
User → "I need $500 MXN in cash near Roma Norte, CDMX"

Agent:
  0.  bazaar_broadcast ($0.005) → Broadcast: "Have ETH, need USDC" to intent layer
  0b. bazaar_accept   ($0.005) → Stellar side locked on-chain (real Soroban tx)
  1.  cash_agents     ($0.001) → Farmacia Guadalupe, 0.3km, tier Maestro 🍄
  2.  reputation      ($0.0005)→ 98% completion, 312 trades, trusted: true
  3.  cash_request    ($0.01)  → HTLC locks USDC, returns claim_url
  4.  Agent → "Go to Orizaba 45. Open: https://app.micopay.xyz/claim/mcr-xxx"

User opens link → full-screen QR on phone → walks to pharmacy → gets $500 MXN cash.
Merchant scans QR → USDC released on Soroban.

Total cost to agent: $0.1215 USDC
```

### Tracks covered

| Track | What we built |
|---|---|
| Paid agent services / APIs | Every endpoint pay-per-request via x402 — no API key ever |
| Agent-to-agent payments | Agent autonomously pays for each service call with USDC |
| Agent marketplaces / discovery | `SKILL.md` + `/api/v1/services` — any agent finds us automatically |
| DeFi integrations | Soroban HTLC escrow (deployed) + AtomicSwapHTLC (built + 37 tests) |
| Agent intent layer (Bazaar) | Social feed where agents broadcast and coordinate cross-chain swaps |

## 🇲🇽 The Problem

Over 60% of Mexico's population is unbanked or underbanked. Cash is king. Crypto on-ramps require bank accounts, KYC, and days of waiting. Even when someone has USDC — earned freelancing, received from abroad, or bought on an exchange — converting it to physical pesos is slow, expensive, and requires infrastructure that doesn't exist in most neighborhoods.

MicoPay is **the Uber of crypto cashout**: anyone with MXN cash can become a liquidity provider — your neighbor, the taquero on the corner, a pharmacy, a tienda. They register, set their rate, and wait for requests. On the other side, anyone with USDC — from any source, any chain — gets matched to the nearest available person and walks away with pesos in minutes.

The HTLC contract is what makes it trustless: the cash provider only receives USDC *after* handing over cash, and the user always gets a full refund if no one shows up. No escrow service, no bank, no intermediary — just two people and a smart contract.

This unlocks scenarios that have no good solution today:

- A freelancer paid in USDC needs rent money by Friday
- A tourist with ETH needs pesos in a neighborhood with no ATM
- **Remittances**: someone's family receives USDC from abroad and needs it as cash the same day — no bank account, no Western Union queue, no 5-day wait
- An AI agent managing a user's finances needs to liquidate USDC without touching a CEX

**AI agents are the perfect interface for this**: they find the best match, verify reputation signals a human would ignore, and handle the entire flow without the user touching crypto at all. And because the API is open to any agent via x402, this network becomes accessible from WhatsApp, Telegram, Claude, or any interface the user already has.

---

## 🕸️ Agent Bazaar — The Social Layer for Agents

The Bazaar is a public intent feed where AI agents broadcast what they have and what they want — and other agents respond. Think of it as a Twitter/X for machine-to-machine liquidity coordination.

```
Agent A posts:  "Have 1.2 ETH on Ethereum. Want 3,200 USDC on Stellar."
Agent B replies: "I'll take it. Here's my quote."
Agent A accepts → Stellar side locked on Soroban via MicopayEscrow HTLC.
AtomicSwapHTLC resolves the ETH side on the other chain.
```

Every action costs a small x402 micropayment — this is what keeps the feed signal-rich and spam-free. Only agents with real liquidity broadcast.

### Bazaar endpoints

| Endpoint | Price | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/bazaar/intent` | $0.005 | Broadcast: "I have X on chain A, want Y on chain B" |
| `GET /api/v1/bazaar/feed` | $0.001 | Read all active intents — live arbitrage and swap opportunities |
| `POST /api/v1/bazaar/quote` | $0.002 | Send a private quote to an intent's agent |
| `POST /api/v1/bazaar/accept` | $0.005 | Seal the deal — locks Stellar side on Soroban as cross-chain collateral |

### Why it matters

> **Demo scope**: The Bazaar today coordinates Stellar ↔ Stellar swaps. True cross-chain (ETH/BTC/SOL) requires an off-chain watcher that reads the published secret from Soroban and claims the counterpart chain — that relayer is the next milestone after the AtomicSwapHTLC contract (37 tests, deployed).

The architecture is designed so that once the relayer is live, any agent on any chain can broadcast an intent and get matched to a MicoPay provider — walking their user to physical MXN cash in Mexico without ever touching a CEX or a bridge.

## 🔐 ZK-as-a-Service — Private resource access for AI agents

> **Real-World ZK on Stellar — live on testnet.** Full docs: [`docs/zk-agent-credentials/`](./docs/zk-agent-credentials/STATUS.md).

**Prove you have the right to consume a resource — without revealing who you are or linking your activity.** AI agents buy an **anonymous access credential** and spend it to consume resources (e.g. Claude inference). The payment is public; the spend is anonymous and **unlinkable to the purchase** — verified with zero-knowledge on Soroban.

This is exactly Stellar's thesis (*"open by default, private when needed"*): a real financial claim proven on-chain without leaking the sensitive part.

### The pipeline — three pieces, none replaces another

```
BUY    POST /api/v1/credentials/buy   (x402, PUBLIC payment)
       → issue an anonymous credential + activate its Merkle root on-chain
            │
SPEND  POST /api/v1/inference          (credential + ZK, ANONYMOUS)
       → ZK proof "I hold a valid, unspent credential" → burn its nullifier
         on-chain → Claude responds
```

- **x402** = how you pay (public — a payment has nothing to hide).
- **credential** = the prepaid ticket (a secret whose commitment lives in the tree).
- **ZK** = makes the spend anonymous + unlinkable, and the on-chain **nullifier** makes each credential **single-use** (anti-spam / no over-consumption).

Even MicoPay can't link a spend back to a purchase (you can't go from `H(secret)` to the commitment without the secret).

### Verified on-chain (Stellar testnet)

- **Contract `ZkVerifierRegistry`:** `CBOWU3OVOPGN3ME2R7EFK2Z2JZY4XYRB6A3HBTQ2Q2WWPSXK3VREUQC7`
- **End-to-end demo:** buy a credential via x402 → generate its ZK proof → `POST /api/v1/inference` → **real Claude completion** (`credential_spent: true`). Re-spending the same credential → `409 NullifierAlreadyUsed` (burn-once proven on-chain).

### Three registered circuits

| Circuit | What it proves | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `access_credential_v1` 🏆 | "I hold a valid, unspent credential in this set" — without revealing which, who I am, or linking my uses | **Flagship.** Burn-once anonymous access (Merkle membership + single-use nullifier). |
| `reputation_v1` | "My reputation tier is ≥ T" — without revealing identity, address, or exact score | Same engine, leaf = tier. Private reputation as an access credential. |
| `poseidon_preimage` | "I know the secret behind this hash" — without revealing it | Building block for HTLC coordination and cross-chain swaps. |

### Why a VK registry (not one contract per circuit)

UltraHonk verification is bound to a circuit via its verification key. A registry keyed by `circuit_id` makes ZKaaS an actual *service*: new circuits are **registered, not redeployed**. It's also the security boundary — the API never accepts a caller-supplied VK (that would let an attacker forge `verified: true` with a trivial circuit). Only the admin registers audited VKs. **One engine, many businesses:** the same membership+nullifier circuit serves inference access, compliance/KYC, ticketing, anti-sybil — only the meaning of the leaf changes.

Built with **Noir + UltraHonk (barretenberg)**, verified inside Soroban via the BN254 host functions (`g1_msm`, `pairing_check` — Protocol 25/26). Hash is BN254 **Pedersen** (Poseidon isn't exported in nargo 1.0.0-beta.9; on-chain verification is hash-agnostic). Status & backlog: [`docs/zk-agent-credentials/STATUS.md`](./docs/zk-agent-credentials/STATUS.md) · value: [`VALUE_PROP.md`](./docs/zk-agent-credentials/VALUE_PROP.md) · toolchain pins: [`TOOLCHAIN.md`](./TOOLCHAIN.md).

## 📱 MicoPay Mobile App

The mobile app (`micopay/frontend`, port 5181) is the user-facing side of the same protocol. It shares the same Soroban contracts and merchant network as the agent API.

> **Demo scope**: The live demo runs against 4 simulated testnet providers. The P2P matching engine and open provider registration are the next implementation milestone (see roadmap).

### Cash In / Cash Out (P2P)
Anyone with MXN cash can join as a liquidity provider — neighbors, street vendors, small shops, anyone. They set their rate and availability; the app matches them with nearby users.

- User selects amount → map shows nearby providers sorted by distance, tier, and availability
- Provider is notified → chat opens for coordination
- USDC is locked on-chain via `MicopayEscrow` HTLC
- User walks to provider → shows QR → receives cash → USDC released
- Provider never gets USDC without giving cash. User always gets a full refund if no one shows.

### 📊 CETES Tokenizados (via Etherfuse)
- Invest in Mexican government bonds tokenized on Stellar
- **~10% APY** — accessible from the same wallet, no broker, no bank account
- Buy/sell with XLM, USDC, or MXNe (uses Stellar `pathPaymentStrictReceive`)
- Full UI implemented; transactions simulated on testnet — mainnet-ready architecture

### 🏦 Blend DeFi
- **Borrow**: Deposit XLM as collateral → get USDC/MXNe instantly (70% LTV, health factor tracked)
- **Yield**: Supply crypto to earn yield via Blend Protocol
- Full UI implemented (pool data, health factor, supply/borrow flows); mainnet-ready architecture

### 🔗 Etherfuse On/Off Ramp
- Architecture supports connecting a Mexican bank account → transfer MXN ↔ USDC on Stellar
- Entry point is the P2P merchant network (cash in/out); full SPEI bridge planned for mainnet

### The claim_url — QR for any interface

When the API's `cash_request` endpoint is called (by an agent OR by the app), it returns a `claim_url`:

```json
{
  "claim_url": "https://app.micopay.xyz/claim/mcr-4b6c0e5c",
  "qr_payload": "micopay://claim?request_id=mcr-4b6c0e5c&secret=...&contract=CBQINHLR...",
  "instructions": "Go to Farmacia Guadalupe, Orizaba 45..."
}
```

The user opens the URL → full-screen QR → shows it to the merchant. **No app install required.** Works from any interface:

| Interface | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Claude / ChatGPT** | Agent pastes the URL in chat |
| **Telegram bot** | Inline button `[Ver QR 📱]` links to the URL |
| **WhatsApp** | Agent sends the URL as a message |
| **MicoPay app** | Renders natively via `ClaimQR.tsx` at `/claim/:id` |

### x402 Flow

```
Agent → POST /api/v1/cash/request
      ← 402 { challenge: { amount_usdc: "0.01", pay_to: "G...", memo: "micopay:cash_request" } }

Agent builds Stellar USDC payment tx, signs it

Agent → POST /api/v1/cash/request
        X-Payment: <signed_xdr>
      ← 201 { claim_url: "https://app.micopay.xyz/claim/mcr-xxx", htlc_tx_hash: "abc...", ... }

### Key design principles

1. **Payment IS authentication** — x402 replaces API keys entirely. No signup, no account, no JWT.
2. **claim_url bridges any agent interface** — Claude, Telegram, WhatsApp, native app — all work identically.
3. **HTLC guarantees atomicity** — Merchant can't get USDC without giving cash. User always gets a refund.
4. **On-chain reputation** — NFT soulbound badges. Can't be bought, transferred, or faked.
5. **One contract, two interfaces** — `MicopayEscrow` powers both the mobile app and the agent API.
6. **The protocol funds itself** — Fund MicoPay proves x402 in 10 seconds, live on-chain.

```bash
cd contracts && cargo test
# atomic-swap:    15 tests ✓
# micopay-escrow: 17 tests ✓

cd micopay/contracts/escrow && cargo test
# micopay-escrow: 5 tests ✓
```

**Deployed on Stellar Testnet:**
- `MicopayEscrow`: `CBQINHLR3M7NZAPQY7EJ3TWOE22R57LMFDVEMOK3C3X7ZIBFWHVQQP3A`
- `AtomicSwapHTLC A`: `CCDOUXIXSFXT2HTJAJGFNUJN6CKCYX2M6AL2BHHPEF6ISNHP2BGLS4KX`

### AtomicSwapHTLC — `contracts/atomic-swap`

Cross-chain HTLC for future multi-chain entry (ETH/BTC/SOL → physical MXN cash). Today: Stellar ↔ Stellar demo. Tomorrow: any chain → Mexico cash.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `lock(initiator, counterparty, token, amount, secret_hash, timeout_ledgers)` | Lock funds. `swap_id = sha256(secret_hash)`. Emits event for cross-chain watchers. |
| `release(swap_id, secret)` | Release to counterparty. **Publishes secret on-chain** — counterparty agent on Chain B reads it to claim there. |
| `refund(swap_id)` | Permissionless refund after timeout. |

### MicopayEscrow — `contracts/micopay-escrow`

P2P escrow powering both the mobile app and the agent API.

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `lock(seller, buyer, amount, platform_fee, secret_hash, timeout_minutes)` | Lock funds + platform fee |
| `release(trade_id, secret)` | Pay buyer + collect platform fee |
| `refund(trade_id)` | Return everything to seller after timeout |

## Security

Contracts reviewed against the Soroban security checklist:

- ✅ All privileged functions require `require_auth()`
- ✅ Re-initialization prevented (`has(Admin)` guard in `initialize()`)
- ✅ Duplicate lock prevention (checks `has(Trade)` before token transfer)
- ✅ Typed `DataKey` enum — no storage key collisions
- ✅ TTL extended proactively on every state change (instance + persistent)
- ✅ `overflow-checks = true` in release profile
- ✅ State machine prevents double-spend / double-release
- ✅ Events emitted for all state changes (full auditability)
- ✅ `opt-level = "z"`, `lto = true`, `panic = "abort"` in release profile
- ✅ x402: USDC issuer verified, tx hash replay protection (in-memory Set), mock mode only in testnet browser UI

## Contributing (Drips Wave 6)

MicoPay is participating in **Stellar Drips Wave 6**. Contributions are scoped to the retail mobile app — not the whole monorepo.

### Current Wave focus

**From single-device demo to a real product.** Today the app simulates both sides of a trade on one phone. Wave 6 makes it real: **one identity per device** and a **real transaction between two phones**, with the UI showing the user's own data instead of hardcoded placeholders.

The full plan, prioritized findings, issue queue, and acceptance criteria live in **[`docs/AUDIT_APK_WAVE6.md`](./docs/AUDIT_APK_WAVE6.md)** — read it before picking up work. The milestones below organize that work; every milestone (UI Truth, Backend Hardening, Product & Release, Market & User Validation) exists to make the core retail flow trustworthy. If you are unsure where to start, pick an issue from **Core Retail Flow (P0)** first.

### In-scope paths

- `micopay/frontend/` — retail mobile app (React/Vite, port 5181)
- `micopay/backend/` — retail backend (Node/Fastify, port 3002)
- `docs/` — shared product, UX, and team guides

### Out-of-scope unless an issue explicitly opens it

- `apps/api/` (agent x402 protocol API)
- `apps/web/` (protocol dashboard)
- `contracts/` (Soroban contracts)
- `stitch_remix_of_micopay/`, old prototypes, deployment configs, and operations internals

### Where to start

1. Read [`docs/AUDIT_APK_WAVE6.md`](./docs/AUDIT_APK_WAVE6.md) — **the Wave 6 plan**: findings, issue queue, stages, and acceptance criteria.
2. Read [`docs/PRODUCT_SCOPE.md`](./docs/PRODUCT_SCOPE.md) — what we are building and why.
3. Read [`docs/RETAIL_ROADMAP.md`](./docs/RETAIL_ROADMAP.md) — the phased execution plan.
4. Read [`docs/UX_MANIFESTO.md`](./docs/UX_MANIFESTO.md) — the trust and UX bar every PR is reviewed against.
5. Read [`docs/DRIPS_TEAM_GUIDE.md`](./docs/DRIPS_TEAM_GUIDE.md) — how issues, reviews, and merges work during the Wave.
6. Pick an issue from the [open milestones](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/milestones).

### Milestones

| Milestone | Focus |
|---|---|
| [Core Retail Flow (P0)](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/milestone/14) | **Wave priority.** One identity per device, real counterparty, real wallet balance, APK fetch fix, minimal onboarding + key backup (P0-1…P0-5) |
| [UI Truth (P1)](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/milestone/15) | Map, economics, agent name, and FX rate use real data instead of placeholders (P1-1…P1-4) |
| [Backend Hardening](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/milestone/16) | Fail-fast prod config, no in-memory fallback, no demo seed, reproducible migrations + `init.sql` fix, real health/readiness (B-2…B-7) |
| [Product & Release](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/milestone/17) | Label DeFi (CETES/Blend) as simulated; APK release config — push, signing, code-splitting (P2-2, P2-3) |
| [Market & User Validation](https://github.com/ericmt-98/micopay-protocol/milestone/18) | Privacy-first research feeding the SDF case — demand, supply, onboarding, trust (V-1…V-5, `research`) |

### Labels we use

- **Wave surface:** `wave:retail`, `wave:frontend`, `wave:backend`, `wave:merchant`, `wave:trust`, `wave:docs`
- **Complexity:** `complexity: low`, `complexity: medium`, `complexity: high`
- **Flow control:** `wave:good-first`, `wave:blocked`, `wave:needs-product`
- **Research:** `research` marks market/user validation issues (no code, no PR — close on a structured answer)
- **Rewards:** `Stellar Wave` marks work eligible for Drips

### What a good PR looks like

- Solves the issue as scoped (no side quests)
- Does not touch out-of-scope paths
- Matches the tone of UX_MANIFESTO for anything user-facing
- Includes local test notes when behavior changes
- Stays under the complexity tier declared on the issue

Review SLA during the Wave: first review within 24 hours.
